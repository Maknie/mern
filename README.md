1. Type: ``` npm install ``` to install all the required dependencies.
2. Change project name in ``` package.json ``` file.
3. Create your own ``` .env ``` file. (Don't forget to include it in ``` .gitignore ``` file).
4. Add ``` MONGO_URL ```,``` PORT ``` fields in the ``` .env ``` file
5. React boilerplate created by ``` create-react-app ``` command, so don't forget to clean it up
